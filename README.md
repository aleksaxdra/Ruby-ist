CRUD web application to store and manage ratings of restaurants.
It stores pairs of "names" - names of restaurants, and rating - from 1 to 10.
You can add new rating, delete, and edit your ratings.
You can also view existing restaurants - bad or good ones. They are divided by rating. Good restaurants are those above rating of "5".
